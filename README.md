# Windows Keybindings

Goal of this repo is to fix the windows keybindings.

# Stuff
Mostly using script.ahk currently which is just a auto hot key script. Was using keyboard-manager,
but that caused endless headaches and simply isn't configurable enough to make windows keybindings
somewhat consistent.

There's also a settings file for the newer windows terminal that seems to work better then trying
to fix mappings in AHK with the default settings.

Windows is wildly inconsitent with it's keybindings, and generally just fucked. This will probably
take a very long time to get right.
